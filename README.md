### Hi there 👋

Hello everyone, my name is Mohammed ELABIDI and I'm a software engineer with expertise in web development, database administration, system Linux administration, IoT engineering,and Python automation. I'm currently studying at ibn tofail university and I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems.

👨‍💻 As a web developer, I have experience in using a variety of front-end and back-end technologies such as HTML, CSS bootstrap , JavaScript, vue , php laravel,php codeigniter, and Express.js to build responsive and user-friendly websites.

🔍 In addition to web development, I also have experience in managing MySQL and Oracle databases, including designing database schemas, optimizing queries for performance, and performing CRUD operations.

🐧 As a Linux system administrator, I'm proficient in managing Ubuntu and CentOS servers, automating server tasks with shell scripts, and monitoring server performance.

🌐 My interest in IoT engineering has led me to develop projects that involve Raspberry Pi and Arduino devices, allowing me to collect and analyze data from IoT devices and develop software solutions to control and monitor them.

🚀 When developing software applications, I always take into account the principles of UX design and SCRUM as an agile working method to deliver high-quality products that meet the needs of the end-users.

🐍 In Python development, I have experience in developing software applications using various Python frameworks and libraries such as Django, Flask, and Pygame.
